          <p>The idea of establishing the school came to Mr. Elpidio Balatbat and his wife, Mrs. Pacita Balatbat, the current Directress of Falcon School, after the graduation of Mrs. Lorelai Balatbat-Aunario, the current Academic Chairperson of Falcon School, from the University of the Philippines College of Education. Because of her passion for teaching and love for children, she began as a grade school teacher at the Ateneo de Manila. Her perseverance and dedication convinced her parents that running her own school was her biggest dream. On November 16, 1997, Falcon Learning Center was established as a small pre-school at Falcon Street, initially offering primary education from nursery to grade three.</p>

          <p>Falcon Learning Center got its name from the Falcon bird, a member of the eagle family and known to be the fastest and keenest specie among birds. The Falcon logo resembles much of Ateneo's blue eagle because Mrs. Lai found it difficult to detach herself from Ateneo and teach at this school initially; moreover, it represents the Balatbat family's vision for the children who enroll at the school to soar to great heights like a falcon, achieving excellence and leadership in "a globalized world."</p>
          
          <p>In 2002, the grade school department was moved to a new building at Dahlia Avenue, with the pre-school department remaining at Falcon Street. The first Student Council was launched in 2005 under the supervision of Mrs. Malou Balatbat-Deomano. In the same year, the first issue of The Falconets, the first student publication, was released. The high school department was established in 2007 and was moved to a new structure adjacent to the grade school building at Dahlia Street in 2009. The Cadet Officer's Leadership Training, or C.O.L.T., was commenced in the same year. The first batch of alumnus graduated in March 2011. The school began construction of its new gymnasium in July 2011.</p>
